## Introduction

The goal of this project is to analyze the employee dataset from ABC Company, consisting of 458 rows and 9 columns. The tasks include preprocessing the data, performing various analyses, and presenting the findings graphically.

## Data Preprocessing

- Corrected the "height" column by replacing values with random numbers between 150 and 180 to ensure data consistency.
- Ensured the data integrity before proceeding with the analysis.

## Analysis Tasks

1. **Distribution of Employees Across Each Team**: Determined the distribution and calculated the percentage split relative to the total number of employees.
2. **Segregation Based on Positions**: Analyzed the distribution of employees based on their positions within the company.
3. **Predominant Age Group**: Identified the predominant age group among employees.
4. **Highest Salary Expenditure**: Discovered which team and position have the highest salary expenditure.
5. **Correlation Between Age and Salary**: Investigated if there's any correlation between age and salary and represented it visually.

## Graphical Representations

Created appropriate visualizations for each of the analysis tasks using matplotlib and seaborn.

## Insights Gained

Provided insights gained from the analysis, highlighting key trends, patterns, and correlations within the dataset.
